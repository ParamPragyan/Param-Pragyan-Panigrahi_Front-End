## 1. Explain what the simple List component does.
<p>As props, the List component (which is a memorized component) receives an array of objects. This list's objects all have a text attribute. The List component renders the text property value of all the elements in the list argument as an unordered list. Each unordered list element has a red background by default, which turns green when the element is clicked. This feature might be used to tell the user that a certain element has been selected. At any given moment, just one element can be picked.</p>

## 2. What problems/warnings are there with the code?
a. For function calls, the ``arrow`` function should be used for handling any event.

b. The first element of the array returned by ``useState`` is always ``state``and the second one is ``setState``.

c. The ``isSelected`` property requires a boolean value. This semantic mistake was detected using ``propTypes`` specified for the SingleListItem component. The possible solutionÂ is as follows: ``isSelected={selectedIndex === index}``

d. As we are defining types of array element the ``array`` should be ``arrayOf`` and as for syntax, the ``shapeOf`` should be just ``shape``.

e.  ``*note: we shouldn't be using "defaultProps" for this code as it is going to be deprecated in "React 18.3.0".``
the ``defaultProps`` should pass the items to display instead of being null.

## 3. Please fix, optimize, and/or modify the component as much as necessary.
